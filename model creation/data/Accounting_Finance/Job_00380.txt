Title: Commercial Claims Handler
Webindex: 68702096
Company: Cryer Baker Recruitment Ltd
Description: Superb opportunity with a major Leeds based corporate brokerage boasting a varied and longstanding client portfolio predominately made up of larger, technically complex insurance programmes. This is a key role within the team and will see you playing an important part in the clientâ€™s ongoing relationships. The team in made up of numerous highly regarded account executives, directors and corporate handlers and at a time where many competitors are looking to outsource its claims, our client is keen to ensure the claims expertise remains firmly within the existing team offering valuable advice and support and maintaining a high level of client satisfaction. The ideal applicant will currently be working within a broking environment with a good all round knowledge of commercial and corporate insurances, be able to handle claims from initial inception through to settlement, liaising closely with the client and the insurers to satisfactory conclusion. Although this role is predominately office based, the need may arise from time to time to deal with clients on a face to face basis, therefore previous experience would be beneficial. Alternatively we would be interested to hear from individuals perhaps working for an insurer or adjuster in a general commercial claims role and looking to move across in to a broking environment. Although not a management opportunity, it is likely that you will be required to oversee the lesser experienced commercial claims handlers, providing support and leading by example. Progress towards ACII preferred although not essential.
