Description: As an Events Sales Advisor and the face of Sky, your role will involve travelling around a designated area and chatting to members of the public about our cuttingedge technology and innovative design. Essentially, we would like you to demonstrate live Sky and make a sale. To sell our groundbreaking products, we ask that you have a thirst to succeed, are technically minded and have a real passion for people. It would also be great if you could bring proven sales experience but were more interested in your engagement with the customer. Sky will give you full training in preparation for the role and in return for interrupting a shoppers day and selling our fantastic products you will be rewarded with uncapped commission.
